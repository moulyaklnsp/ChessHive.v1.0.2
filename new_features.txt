New Features Overview

1) Player: Watch
The Watch experience gives players a dedicated space to follow ongoing chess activity without participating in a live match. It is designed for viewing and discovery, keeping players engaged even when they are not actively playing.

What it does
- Provides a spectator-focused page for players to browse and watch chess content.
- Aggregates available viewing sources into a single, clean UI (for example, live boards, streams, or curated content).
- Enables players to quickly switch between different viewing options without leaving the player area.

Why it matters
- Increases player engagement by offering meaningful activity outside of active tournament play.
- Supports campus communities by allowing players to learn from matches and stay connected to events.
- Helps new users explore the platform’s chess ecosystem without needing to enroll or queue.

User flow (high level)
- Player opens the Watch page from the player dashboard.
- The page lists or highlights available viewing options.
- Player selects a source and watches content in a focused viewer.

Design considerations
- Emphasis on a distraction-free viewer layout with quick navigation between sources.
- Optimized to avoid heavy interactions; the page is read‑only by design.
- Works well on common screen sizes for dorm/campus use.

2) Coordinator: Streaming Control
Streaming Control is a coordinator-facing tool that centralizes management of broadcast content for tournaments and events. It enables coordinators to curate viewing experiences that players can access via Watch.

What it does
- Lets coordinators manage streaming inputs (for example, adding, enabling, or updating stream sources).
- Organizes what players see in Watch by controlling available streams and metadata.
- Provides a single administrative surface to keep live viewing content accurate and current.

Why it matters
- Ensures that only valid, up‑to‑date viewing sources are surfaced to players.
- Reduces confusion by aligning official tournament content with the player’s Watch page.
- Gives coordinators a clear operational workflow for live events.

User flow (high level)
- Coordinator opens Streaming Control from the coordinator dashboard.
- Coordinator adds or updates stream information (name, provider, or link).
- Changes are reflected in the player Watch experience.

Design considerations
- Simple, form‑based controls to reduce errors and speed up updates.
- Clear state indicators (active/inactive) for each stream entry.
- Built for quick edits during live events.
